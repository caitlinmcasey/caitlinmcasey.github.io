								<h2>Now Hiring for Fall 2022</h2>

<p>Prospective Postdoctoral scholars are invited to submit
applications to join the Casey research group at UT Austin for Fall
2022 (start dates are flexible on request).  Successful applicants may
work on a variety of different projects and datasets related to
high-redshift galaxy formation and evolution. These include data from
the upcoming JWST Cycle 1 COSMOS-Web Treasury Program, the ALMA 2mm
MORA Program, searching for high-redshift galaxy cluster progenitors
in HETDEX data, and an ambitious project aimed at building a legacy
spectroscopic database for the COSMOS field.  More lengthy
descriptions of each project are given below.</p>

<h3>The COSMOS-Web Survey</h3>

<p>COSMOS-Web is the largest Cycle 1 JWST program (218 hours; PIs are
Casey and Kartaltepe). We will map a contiguous 0.6deg<sup>2</sup> to
a depth of 27.5-28 [AB] in NIRCam with an additional
0.2deg<sup>2</sup> mapped with MIRI in parallel mode observations.
  The primary science goals of COSMOS-Web are to:<br>
(1) dramatically increase the number of galaxies known in the Epoch of
Reionization and map their environments, allowing the first direct
constraints on reionization's patchiness and which galaxies drive the
process.<br>(2) discover hundreds of quiescent galaxies formed in the
Universe's first 2 Gyr, placing fundamental constraints on the growth
of the Universe's most massive galaxies<br> (3) directly constrain the
stellar mass to halo mass relation (SMHR) out to z~2.5 using weak
lensing, setting a new and crucial calibration of cosmological
models.<br>
COSMOS-Web will also do much more.  As a treasury program that will
give us incredibly deep, high-resolution imaging of 10<sup>6</sup>
galaxies, the legacy value of COSMOS-Web will be extraordinary, from
the study of metal-poor halo stars in our own Milky Way to galaxies at
  z=11.</p>

<p>Postdocs who will join the Casey group at UT can expect to be
heavily involved in the COSMOS-Web program.  The observational efforts
to identify EoR galaxies will be led at UT Austin, with substantial
work on massive galaxies at all epochs.  Postdocs in the group may
develop key responsibilities for the delivery of COSMOS-Web products
to the broader community.  There will also be ample opportunity use
these data, as well as data from the broader COSMOS collaboration, to
pursue other projects of interest.</p>

<h3>The COSMOS Spectroscopy Project (CSP)</h3>

<p>The 2deg<sup>2</sup> COSMOS field has accumulated a tremendous
amount of legacy value in the extragalactic community.  As one of the
leaders of the COSMOS team, I see COSMOS as having a unique legacy for
the democratization of science by building cutting-edge products that
are broadly available to all astronomers worldwide.  This philosophy
has been central to the COSMOS team over its 15+ year history, and its
a reason that so many have been able to build their careers from the
diverse datasets in the field.  And over the years, more people have
  brought more data with them.</p>

<p>While ~200,000 galaxies have been spectroscopically observed in the
field as a part of this community-driven effort, the spectra
themselves have not been broadly organized or synthesized into one
database.  These spectra come from facilities like the VLT, Keck,
  Gemini, and Subaru.</p>

<p>This project aims at collating these data from different facilities to
build an ambitious, new, spectroscopic database for COSMOS.  With it,
we will be in a unique position to explore the Universe in three
dimensions and uniquely search for and characterize overdense
structures from 0&#60;z&#60;4, uniquely constrain environment-dependent galaxy
characteristics, improve measurements of the dark energy equation of
state, and use galaxies' spectra to construct IGM tomographic maps.
Postdocs working on this project may have keen interest in data
structures and OIR spectroscopy.</p>

<h3>Observing the Formation of Massive Galaxy Clusters</h3>

<p>In a joint project between the Casey and Finkelstein groups at UT,
we are assembling a dataset of 60,000 1.9<z<3.5 Lyman-alpha emitters
(LAEs) over a 10deg<sup>2</sup> area, covering both the NEP and COSMOS
fields.  These LAEs are detected blindly using the VIRUS instrument on
the Hobby Eberly Telescope (HET); VIRUS is a wide-field IFU operating
at 3500-5500 angstroms.  Some of this data also overlaps with data
observed in the HETDEX project.</p>

<p>Such a dataset is uniquely useful for constraining the Universe's
protocluster population -- or the progenitors of massive galaxy
clusters.  Without galaxy pre-selection, VIRUS will take census of the
Universe's large scale overdensities and underdensities, allowing
direct identification of thousands of protoclusters, and the first
large statistical samples of such structures.  By directly comparing
newly identified structures to quasars (also identified by VIRUS) and
dusty starbursts (identified in Herschel data), we can begin to
constrain the stochasticity of protocluster growth, observationally
addressing the fundamental mechanism by which galaxy clusters -- the
Universe's largest gravitationally bound structures -- are formed.</p>
						
<p>Postdocs interested in this project can expect to analyze
pre-processed VIRUS data (reduced using the HETDEX pipeline), help
identify quasars in these datasets, as well as perform cross
correlations with Herschel and VLA datasets over 10deg<sup>2</sup>
scales, with potential for significant contributions to protocluster
studies.</p>

<h3>Mapping Obscuration to Reionization with ALMA (MORA)</h3>

<p>The MORA Survey began in ALMA Cycle 6 with 15 hours of band 4 time
awarded to map 184arcmin<sup>2</sup> area in 2mm continuum; the goals
of MORA are to directly constrain the volume density of Dusty
Star-Forming Galaxies (DSFGs) to cosmic star formation at z>4, which
has been notoriously difficult to constrain over the 20+ years we have
known about this population of extreme starbursting galaxies.  This
early epoch is particularly important for DSFG formation because of
their uniquely high mass (similar or higher than host galaxies of
high-z quasars) and their enormous reservoirs of dust
(M<sub>dust</sub>~10<sup>9</sup>M<sub>sun</sub>), established in an
era where dust formation mechanisms are poorly understood.</p>

<p>Several MORA papers have been published from this first round of data
(Zavala et al. 2021, Casey et al. 2021, and soon-to-come Manning et
al. 2021), suggesting the number density of DSFGs at z>4 is rather
low.  However, we do find that 2mm is uniquely efficient at recovering
the z>4 DSFG population, espeically compared to shorter wavelength surveys.</p>

<p>Due to its efficiency at identifying unique, z>4 DSFGs, the MORA
program earned a 36 hour extension in ALMA Cycle 8 to quadruple the
survey area to cover a total of 0.2deg<sup>2</sup>.  This
0.2deg<sup>2</sup> will be embedded within the footprint of
COSMOS-Web, allowing unique and immediate characterization of
near-infrared stellar emission in these extreme, dusty systems.
Similarly, MORA will provide crucial constraints on ISM content of new
discoveries in COSMOS-Web through stacking analysis, as individual
source follow-up of JWST discoveries with ALMA will be prohibitive for
large samples.</p>

<p>Postdocs interested in MORA will be able to get involved in the
Cycle 8 data analysis (expected to complete by mid-2022) and related
papers, particularly as they relate to synergies with the COSMOS-Web
data (ready by mid-2023).</p>
