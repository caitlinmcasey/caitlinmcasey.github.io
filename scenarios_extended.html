<br><td><a href="#relative"><b>First, a look at the relative rankings of the scenarios (comparing means and median ranks from 465 participants).</b></a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s01"> 1. Beth is attending her first AAS meeting and has a difficult time with a critical colleague reviewing her poster. Her advisor, Pam, takes her aside and reassures her about her abilities and tells her to forget about the incident and move forwards.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s02"> 2. Mark is hiring a new postdoc this year and is deciding between Melinda and Aaron who are both well qualified. Mark has noticed that Melinda has asked many interesting questions during conference talks and seems to be more vocal, so he is leaning towards hiring her rather than Aaron.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s03"> 3. Kwan notices that the young "stars" in his field are assertive, loud and vocal during meetings - they interrupt the speakers seemingly having no respect for them. He is not comfortable interrupting speakers or arguing in front of a crowd and decides to leave the field.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s04"> 4. Jin thinks it is important to spend some of his time working on outreach and diversity issues but he is told by his advisor to not do so because its a waste of time.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s05"> 5. Nathaniel and Lucia are in the same department. Nathaniel, a tenured professor, wants to date Lucia even though she is his colleague's graduate student. He decides it is ok because he is not her employer.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s06"> 6. An astronomy department is dominated by males (70%) but since the ratio of female to male is slightly above the average for other departments the senior male scientists conclude that the department has more than enough females and there should be no further effort to proactively diversify the department.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s07"> 7. Amanda plans on supervising some undergrads, Joe and Michelle, over the summer.  She thinks that men and women typically have different working and learning styles so she plans on spending more time talking with Michelle than Joe.  She doesn't think Michelle is any less bright than Joe, but she knows from her own experience, how much it helped her to have one-on-one discussions and she wants to make sure that Michelle stays in the field.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s08"> 8. Mason gives a talk at a conference on some unpublished, new work.  A senior scientist in the audience is skeptical of the work and tries convincing Mason it is a waste of time.  Mason tries to engage this senior scientist in a dialogue about the work over email but doesn't hear back; later that month, the senior scientist posts a submitted paper on the arXiv based on Mason's idea but does not credit nor acknowledge Mason.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s09"> 9. Jack, a professor, is flirtatious with Jill, a new postdoc in the department.  Jack, the chair of the local TAC appoints Jill as a TAC member.  When Jill makes it clear that she does not want a relationship with Jack her proposals for telescope time are less successful than they used to be.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s10"> 10. Brian was shortlisted for a faculty job, but the job went to a woman instead.  Brian feels that it's unfair, because he thinks he would have gotten the job if he were a woman.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s11"> 11. Blair, a student, feels very uncomfortable in the astronomy department because there are problems with senior faculty bullying, taunting, and harassing other students.  Blair would tell the department chair how uncomfortable and hostile the environment has become, but decides not to because Blair fears that as a result, the chair (and the faculty responsible) would no longer take Blair seriously as a researcher.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s12"> 12. Gale is telling a joke about homosexuals over coffee with colleagues.  Gerry, who identifies as homosexual, overhears and is offended.  Gerry privately lets Gale know that the statement was offensive, but Gale continues to joke at work about homosexuals since Gale wants to continue to have the same friendship with the other colleagues.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s13"> 13. Bob and Jason are teammates in a big collaboration. Jason plans to submit a proposal for telescope time and circulates it to the team 2 days before the deadline on the wiki. Bob sends an email to Jason a few hours before the deadline saying that he will use the text and figures from Jason's proposal to submit his own proposal and asks Jason to withdrawal his proposal.  He argues that he is justified because he as added Jason as a co-I on his proposal.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s14"> 14. Lucas is a new foreign student in the department and the chair has gone out of her way to pair him with a mentor from his own country. She has also organized a special welcome for Lucas where various traditions of the country were recognized and celebrated.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s15"> 15. Linda is organizing a meeting and is thinking of who the invited speakers should be.  She thinks that it would be good to invite more women and junior researchers but thinks the more senior male researchers will give better more provocative talks so she invites them.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s16"> 16. Jim is a postdoc. He finds out that his work is being plagiarized by a former postdoctoral fellow from the same group. When he tells his supervisor about the incident, she tells him that if people are copying his work he should view that as a sign of doing interesting research. She tells him that he should not worry about the competitors and instead focus on doing a solid job and publish the results.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s17"> 17. Hugo has a meeting with his supervisor.  His supervisor tells him he's not working very hard, and she expects him to put in nights and weekends in addition to working weekdays. Hugo loves research but since he believes he is less productive when working long hours decides to leave the field.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s18"> 18. Jane and John are new faculty members in a male-dominated department. Jane is told that she must serve on more faculty committees than John because they need a woman.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s19"> 19. Cynthia, a postdoctoral fellow, receives an email from a senior scientist after her paper is posted to arXiv.  The senior scientists' work is cited in Cynthia's paper.  The email is a one-liner, which reads, "For someone who knows nothing about SMGs, you have a very negative opinion of my work."</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s20"> 20. Morgan is interviewing for a faculty job at a university. During the more "casual periods" of the interview (dinner, coffee), Morgan is asked several times by different faculty members, "Do you have kids? Are you married? Are you in a relationship?"</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s21"> 21. Janine doesn't feel comfortable wearing skirts or dresses to work because the older professors always comment on how nice she looks and they sometimes stare at her breasts and whistle at her in the hallway.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s22"> 22. Leslie, a pre-tenure astronomer, takes a parental leave after having a baby.  Leslie's colleagues think parental leave is a free ride, and Leslie should be more productive at research during this time because of the lack of teaching commitment.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s23"> 23. As one of only two women in the department, Amy continuously threatens to sue the department for gender discrimination whenever something does not go her way.  She is constantly throwing her colleagues under the bus and constantly saying that no one seems to appreciate her.  Recently when her colleague Simon got a lucrative endowed chair offer at another university, she marched into the chair's office and screamed at him, threatening to leave if Simon was offered tenure for retention even though Simon's advancement / position and work has no impact on her tenure case or work situation.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s24"> 24. Jorge is working on a paper which he thinks is ready for submission.  He sends the paper to the collaborators for comments but does not hear back for a few months even after repeated requests for comments.  Eventually, he insists on submitting his paper with or without their comments and offers them the option to step off the paper if they would prefer. In response, his senior collaborators threaten to report him to the journal and threaten to tarnish his name to any future employers, claiming that he is unethical because he has submitted a paper without the approval of the co-authors.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#s25"> 25. Robin is invited to a conference. Robin replies to the organizer, Ricardo (who he has never met), that he is happy to attend, but he is wondering if it is possible to travel with his family, including a newborn. In response, Ricardo says, "yes of course, feel free to bring your husband and children!"</a>

<a name="relative"><h3>THE RELATIVE RANKING OF SCENARIOS FROM "BEST" TO "WORST"</h3>

<img src="scenarios_png/relativeranking.png" width="600"><br>
<table width="600">
<tr><td> Here we show the relative rankings of all 25 scenarios and
sort them from most unethical, unacceptable, or undesirable to most
desired.  The names of each scenario are given as shorthand.  We
calculated both means with standard deviations (blue points) and
median ranks with 68.3% confidence intervals (red diamonds).<br><br>
One of the most interesting results is the difference in ranking spread, or relative
community concensus among scenarios.  Through user free-response
feedback, participants told us they were most uncomfortable judging
the following scenarios because they were too ambiguous: 3
(Kwan), 10 (Brian), 11 (Blair), 17 (Hugo), and 24 (Jorge).  However, as
shown here, those scenarios are <i>not</i> the scenarios with the
largest dispersion; instead, the following scenarios were
quantitatively found to be the most ambiguous: 5 (Nathanial), 7
(Amanda), 14 (Lucas), 20 (Morgan), and 25 (Robin).  What does this
mean?

"Pam does well to reassure the student, but she shouldn't tell the student to forget about the incident. There is always something to be learned from criticism, even unconstructive or hurtful criticism."
<br>
"Beth's behavior seems normal. Pam's behavior seems very ethical and the critical colleague's too. It is never unfair to be critical provided the criticism is constructive."
<br>
"Encouragement is valuable, but criticism shouldn't be disregarded simply because it is 'tough'."

<td width="300">Mark is free to decide on qualified candidates as he sees fit, and therefore we judged this scenario as acceptable. However, would you have reacted differently if Melinda and Aaron were switched, i.e. Aaron was the more vocal candidate? Did gender play a role in your assessment of the acceptability of this scenario? If so, why? Many readers might judge the reverse gender scenario to be somehow unfair, while this scenario as presented is arguably fair. We speculate that the discrepancy is caused by the perception that women are far less vocal than men at conferences.  If this is true, what is causing it? Is there a gender stereotype threat for women that makes them less vocal during conferences?  Although here Mark acted appropriately, we would encourage Mark to be aware of subtle biases which might influence how vocal Aaron and Melinda are at meetings.  The situation is potentially negative for diversification efforts if Mark judges his candidates solely on a characteristic which tends to follow a gender divide.</td>
<td width="300"><i>
"I hope that 'interesting questions' means profound questions and not just showing up. If her behavior matches the general rules of politeness (asking questions after a talk, not interrupting etc.) the abilities to communicate and to be scientifically interested as well as critical are required skills in modern science."
<br>
"As the scenario is presented, I definitely think that giving the job to 'the vocal' Melinda is a definite good thing! However, it is interesting for me to realize that if the names were switched and Melinda was the quiet one, I would urge Mark to consider that Aaron probably has being applauded for being vocal through his life, while Melinda might have very interesting insights -- but a bit too shy to blurt them out in conferences."
<br>
"Engagement is often important, but introverts can do fantastic work too. It is rare that the degree of extroversion is the only differentiating factor."

<tr><td width="300"><img src="scenarios_png/s03.png" width="300"></td>
<td width="300">This is undesired, since we would hope people decide to stay or go based on their interest in the science rather than more human limitations. While Kwan's decision is totally his own, and is acceptable, the community might want to recognize that it is loosing good people and should strive to be a more inviting, inclusive environment for multiple personality types, not just those who are naturally assertive and loud.</td>
<td width="300">
<i>
"Unnecessary loudness should not be what distinguishes a good scientist from a bad one. On the other hand, leaving the field because of a feeling of too hard competition (in a situation when it's arguably not appropriate) doesn't seem to be a solution either. It's a general problem in modern society that who's loudest gets most, not only in science."
<br>
"Whether Kwan wants to leave is his decision, but it'd be a shame if he thought those yahoos were representative of the whole field."
<br>
"It's good that Kwan is self aware and he should know better that to be loud and vocal does not make a good scientist."
<br>
"Kwan's decision to leave the field seems perfectly ethical, and indeed we should encourage people who object to certain aspects of the way their field is practiced to not tacitly give approval by participating in it themselves (though perhaps staying in the field and actively trying to change its practices would be more useful than simply removing oneself from it.) On the other hand, the young "stars," their behavior seems bordering on unacceptable."
<br>
"What is the ethical issue here? Someone reaches a judgement about how he thinks other people behave, doesn't like it, and leaves. Good for him? Bad for the field? Maybe it's good that he left."
<br>
"Nothing wrong with this up until the bit about 'leaving the field', which seems like a huge overreaction when very few people are as aggressive as described."
<br>
"Leaving because of a tough culture is never desirable. Tough-but-fair colleagues are normal & Kwan should have tried to talk with them about what he thought of both the technical points and the way they were presented."
<br>
"Because it is the other students being rude, Kwan should bring this up with someone in the department. The fact that Kwan chooses to leave the field is a big problem."
<br>
"The young stars' behavior is unacceptable if they are not showing respect for the speaker and they should be told that this type of behavior is unacceptable. However, I can relate to Kwan's feelings of isolation in such an environment."
<br>
"Kwan's behavior isn't really unacceptable, it is more very unfortunate or overly passive (he needs a good mentor)."

While his advisor might not value his interest in outreach, Jin might be engaging in those activities because he is planning on pursuing an outreach or teaching-based career post-PhD. His advisor should be aware of his intentions, but also be clear about the expectations for Jin's research and timeline for completion. If Jin and his advisor cannot reach resolution on how to balance his time, Jin and/or the advisor should seek the advise of other professors in the department (i.e. graduate chair, Jin's second advisor, etc).</td>
<td width="300">
<i>
"Unfortunately, still common practice. I'm more worried about those situations in which supervisors are aware that outreach activity should be communicated in a positive manner while they themselves silently disagree. Often times they make clear to set different priorities than research by other means than openly saying that it's a waste of time."
<br>
"The advisor is entitled to his/her opinion. The rating depends on whether "told to" means "advised to" or "ordered to". My reaction would be to tell the student that being involved in outreach/diversity might cause him/her to take longer to finish the degree but leave the decision up to him/her."
<br>
"context is important here, is it free time or research time? If the student procrastinating completing research the advisor hired him the advisor might have grounds to complain although certainly calling it a 'waste of time' is very inappropriate."
<br>
"Outreach is important for publicly-funded work. That said, it can be easy to get distracted from other important research activities and it can be easy to mis-judge the impact of dealing with the public."

Some institutes have regulations forbidding romantic relationships between co-workers when there is a power differential (i.e. tenured professor to student) while others only forbid relationships along direct employer-employee lines, and others allow all variety of workplace consensual relationships. If Lucia regards Nathaniel's interest in her as unwelcome, the situation becomes more problematic and can be called sexual harassment, creating a hostile work environment for Lucia.</td>

"The situation can only be evaluated if it is stated whether the professor was acting in accordance with university policy. Relationships complicate academia, but they are not forbidden."
<br>
"Could vary wildly based on Lucia's view of things..."
<br>
"Such relationships seem ethically undesirable but if there's real attraction from both sides, no clear-cut dependence over the different hierarchy levels, it needs to be accepted."
<br>
"The scenario doesn't say anything about Nathaniel making unwelcome advances or threatening Lucia's career, which would be blatantly unethical. In theory, they could just be two consenting adults. But even without further details, I think Nathaniel's choice to pursue Lucia shows spectacularly bad professional and personal judgment."

<td width="300">This is bullying and threat of slander. Jorge's senior collaborators have been given ample time to offer comments and criticisms on Jorge's paper, and they have been given the opportunity to remove themselves from the paper, but instead they decide to respond by threatening Jorge, perhaps with the intention of delaying Jorge from submitting. Nevertheless, the threats to report him to the journal and contact future employers is slander if it has the intention of tarnishing Jorge's reputation as a scientist without recounting the truth (or entire truth) about the scenario. Some things to consider here are what agreement Jorge and his collaborators had when he started to write this paper; was there a verbal agreement? Was there a written agreement? Could they have avoided this conflict by being more clear in the beginning about both parties' expectations?</td>

"Senior colleagues are out of bounds. Should have taken them off the paper."
<br>
"Would be nice to know if the senior scientists had specific criticisms of the work that they wanted changed."
<br>
"I am really fed up with the game playing coauthors continually try and get away with. Ignoring emails is my number one annoyance! If they have a problem with the paper, just be up front about it. It's unethical for people to bully those writing the paper with such threats!"
<br>
"A clear example of bad communication practice. When giving so many chances to the co-authors to comment what is the poor guy supposed to do eventually?"
<br>
"Jorge should dump anyone who has sent no feedback from the authorlist."
<br>
"I think Jorge acted correctly."

Robin replies to the organizer, Ricardo (who he has never met), that he is happy to attend, but he is wondering if it is possible to travel with his family, including a newborn. In response, Ricardo says, "yes of course, feel free to bring your husband and children!"</h3>

<td width="300">Ricardo has assumed Robin is a female, possibly because Robin enquired if it is possible to travel with his family. This is an undesired reaction to Robin's email, as it is a gender-based assumption that male researchers would not want (or have to) travel to conferences with their families. However, it's clearly unintentional, and overall, Ricardo's effort to be supportive of families shoes great effort.</td>

"It shouldn't have been assumed that Robin was a woman, but at least the conference organiser is making every effort to be completely family friendly, which is very positive."
<br>
"Seems like a sloppy typo and that we should laugh about it."
<br>
"This reveals some stereotyping, but is actually a good thing in the end."
<br>
"This rated high for good intentions. Clueless but helpful."
<br>
"As a woman with a name that could apply to either gender, #25 hit home. I find it frustrating when it happens, but as long as they accept the correction gracefully, I think taking offense is unwarranted. I usually laugh."
<br>
"Organizers make mistakes and that's just human."
<br>
"This hits home, as once I mistakenly used the honorific 'Mr.' in an email to someone whose first name was ____. Trying to be respectful, I ended up being potentially offensive. Lesson learned!"

<a name="sgen"><h3>General Survey Feedback</h3>

<table border=0 width="900">
<tr><td>
<i>
"For all the gendered scenarios, I tried flipping the gender of each person in the situation and rereading it. This was an insightful exercise; several of my answers changed after the gender swap."
<br><br>
"My view is that I can try to tolerate bad jokes, offense, etc, but I cannot stand someone screwing my work."
<br><br>
"In most cases I am used to being presented with hypothetical scenarios that are either unethical or ethical-where the ethical action is neither undesirable behavior nor necessarily desirable behavior. This scale also made it a bit hard to consider many of the situations, though this could be because of the kinds of questions I am used to considering."
<br><br>
"I think the survey should be clearer on whose behavior is being evaluated. Judging the community's standards from this exercise will not be possible if it is unknown what behavior is eliciting any given response."
<br><br>
"Other studies have shown that gender-specific names trigger unconscious biases. By using names here, you might be folding those biases into the survey results."
<br><br>
"It's possible to imagine some of these situations (18, 19, 22, 23) being a bit more nuanced if presented differently."
<br><br>
"I would be interested to know the demographics of survey-takers, to see if there are differences between genders or different career stages, etc. For instance, if only graduate students respond to the survey, I suspect the result would be quite different than if only tenure-track faculty respond. Knowing how your audience affects your results is worth studying. Still - thank you for candidly presenting so many elephants in so many astronomy departments everywhere."
<br><br>
"Excellent range of scenarios; good variety."
<br><br>
"In [some] cases the outcome is unfortunate, but no-one's 'fault'."
<br><br>
"I didn't see many references/questions to ethnic minorities. It seemed heavily weighed towards women and families. Are women and families almost the norm these days?"
<br><br>
"The ambiguity on whose actions are considered undesirable weakens the strength of this poll. It may reveal something on where the focus of the reader lies in reading the scenario or with whom they identify..."
<br><br>
"Many of the scenarios dealt with younger and more diverse scientists encountering problems with older scientists. The conflicts that arise out of these scenarios are often the result of older scientists being 'set in their ways' and being resistant to change. We work in a field that is constantly changing and developing. Old ideas are proven to be incorrect and replaced almost every day so why shouldn't our behaviour toward other people evolve as well?"
<br><br>
"After finishing this survey I think the survey itself is ingeniously organized to exemplify a point, or intrinsically flawed. I can't tell which (sorry). The survey questions almost always involve the actions of one or more individuals which who act on opposite sides of the ethical spectrum. The survey does not indicate the individual whose behavior we are to judge as ethical/acceptable or unethical/unacceptable. Therefore the reader must first attempt to identify whose behavior must be judged, then assign a rank to that activity. This is ingenious because it creates an apparent conflict within the survey taker. This is flawed because it is unclear whose actions the survey taker is ranking, hence it will create an unnecessary spread in the response to the question."
<br><br>
"These situations are all too common. Someone taking the survey may give the situation a "1" but engage in the behavior nonetheless because the academic culture we live in permits unacceptable behavior to exist and flourish. Individuals who dare call out the offenders are often run off."
<br><br>
"Some of these are all too familiar. I would comment, but I am afraid of being identified. "
<br><br>
"Good questions, with *a lot* (too much??) resemblance to real life situations..."
<br><br>
"Most of these are clearly 'bad,' but a few seem to reflect innocent confusion or hastiness, and I think it's important to distinguish these from some of the others.  Though the latter can be harmful, too, the tools you need to use to 'stop' them are arguably different than for the more overtly unethical behaviour sampled in some of the other questions."
<br><br>
"I found it difficult to judge the best response to many answers because there were often positive and negative elements. I usually weighed the negative more heavily and responded accordingly. "
<br><br>
"This survey is certainly an interesting way to begin a discussion politics and professional relationships within an academic setting."
